With a passion for olympic lifting and cross training, look out for a well-rounded workout with maybe too much rock music to go along with it.",

      "Jasmine without the J. When she’s not behind the bar serving up a mean cup of coffee or designing for clients, she’s on her spin bike grooving to some Indie rock tunes. If you’re in luck, you could find yourself in a heart-pumping trance class. A Jill of all trades, master of everything, Asmine hustles round-the-clock and juggles multiple gigs at any one time. Her love for fitness is accompanied by her love for sweet things so much so that a tooth has been sacrificed (RIP Asmine’s tooth). Wild, fun and easy-going, there’s never a dull moment with her.",

      "He may look well-adjusted in the gym but deep down, Jaysen is a goofball. Okay. Maybe not so deep down. In whatever he’s doing though, Jaysen always aims to show up authentically, and is committed to giving you his hundred percent inside the studio and out. He doesn’t believe in ‘one-size-fits-all’ with things fitness and beyond, so he’d like nothing more than for you to just come as you are. His ambition in fitness can be summarised by Jim Carrey’s quote: You can fail at the things you don’t like, so might as well do what you love.",
